# USB HID Descriptor Parser

This parser is inspired by the [USB Descriptor and Request Parser](https://eleccelerator.com/usbdescreqparser/) written by Frank Zhao.

## Platforms

The goal is that the library will work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.  
Currently there is a prolbem with Windows, where it doesn't print the full HID Descriptor.
